                Forex Investment Scam Recovery

                Forex is the single largest traded market globally, with up to
                five trillion traded each day and is considered decentralized
                because there is no central processor for trades– in other
                words, there is no entity that acts as a central exchange like
                the NASDAQ or the NYSE. Instead, orders are completed by
                millions of traders using millions of various forex brokers
                around the world.

                Foreign currency trading is one of the most leveraged markets in
                the world as well. In the US, regulations limit a person to 50:1
                leverage. In other countries, they have zero limits on leverage.
                It is not uncommon to see some non-US brokers offer 1000+:1. Due
                to these factors and a few others which we will discuss, this is
                why scams can be so prevalent within the foreign exchange
                market.

              <p className="desc body-2 color-on-suface-variant-1 mb-20">
                In the investment world, forex is the wild-west of traditional
                financial instruments. However, most of the participants are
                massive institutions like banks that help companies manage
                cross-currency rates for payroll or buying goods. But it is by
                far the most accessible and cheapest investment for anyone to
                make. A futures broker may require a $5,000 minimum investment;
                whereas many firms in the foreign exchange markets require as
                little as $1. Day trading stocks in the US requires a $25,000
                minimum balance; forex does not require this.
              </p>
              <p className="desc body-2 color-on-suface-variant-1 mb-20">
                The ease of access to significant leverage, and the fact it is
                open 24 hours a day all make it the most appealing market. But
                this also attracts many of the bad actors. Some countries
                regulate forex markets – but not always to the same degree as
                the US. Many countries have little to no regulation and allow
                anyone to open a brokerage account in their country. There are
                many, many bad brokers around the globe – so it's often best to
                stick with brokers that are based in the US, EU, or UK.
